# MasterDetector

Our study on anomaly detection with error repairing by master data in multivariate time series.

- `code/` includes the codes for experiments.
- `Appendix.pdf` includes the experiment results on three other datasets.

The proposed methods have been deployed and included as a function in an open-source time series database Apache IoTDB, for anomaly detection with data repairing. 
The introduction document is available in the [system website](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/Operators-Functions/Anomaly-Detection.html#masterdetect), and the code of our proposal is included in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/tree/research/master-detector) of the system.
